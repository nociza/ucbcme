        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

        <p>
          Information we collect falls into one of two categories: &quot;voluntarily provided&quot;
          information and &quot;automatically collected&quot; information. &quot;Voluntarily
          provided&quot; information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us
          when using or participating in any of our services and promotions. &quot;Automatically
          collected&quot; information refers to any information automatically sent by your devices
          in the course of accessing our products and services.
        </p>

        <h4>Log Data</h4>

        <p>
          When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided
          by your web browser. It may include your device&#39;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your
          browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time
          spent on each page, and other details about your visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically
          collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data
          may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error
          happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not
          receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or
          what the nature of the error is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself,
          it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual
          persons.
        </p>

        <h4>Device Data</h4>

        <p>
          When you visit our website or interact with our services, we may automatically collect
          data about your device, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Device Type</li>
          <li>Geo-location data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software. We
          recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn
          what information they make available to us.
        </p>

        <h4>User-Generated Content</h4>

        <p>
          We consider &quot;user-generated content&quot; to be materials (text, image and/or video
          content) voluntarily supplied to us by our users for the purpose of publication on our
          website or re-publishing on our social media channels. All user-generated content is
          associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of publication will be public
          after posting (and subsequent review or vetting process). Once published, it may be
          accessible to third parties not covered under this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>

        <p>
          We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our
          website:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content</li>
          <li>Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies</li>
          <li>When you mention us on social media</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with
          general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example,
          Our marketing and market research activities may uncover data and insights, which we may
          combine with information about how visitors use our site to improve our site and your
          experience on it.
        </p>

        <h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>

        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we
          will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
          unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. Although we will do our
          best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of
          electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data
          security.
        </p>

        <p>
          {' '}
          You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring
          the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example,
          ensuring you do not make your personal information publicly available via our platform.
        </p>

        <h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>

        <p>
          We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may
          depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy.
          For example, if you have provided us with personal information such as an email address
          when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the
          duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may
          effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer
          required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
          that identify you.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a
          legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public
          interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
        </p>
